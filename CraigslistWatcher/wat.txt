Personally, I think, in situations like this, the punishment for the crime should be deferred to the victim's family first.  If they refuse to choose a suitable punishment and enact said punishment, then he goes to the state.  And then the state kills him in the exact way he killed his victim(s).  If not every method the criminal used against his victim(s) cannot be incorporated in to his punishment, then the state chooses the worst of them.

And it should be a public event.  These people understand fear.  They respond to it.  Someone who ties up another man and drags him behind his car is not brave man.  He is a coward.  And when he sees what the rest of us do to cowards like him, he will refrain from such actions.

Is this method extreme?  Sure.  Would I replicate this monster's actions to send a message to potential monsters in an attempt to keep myself and my family safe?  In a heartbeat.  This piece of shit is, at worst, a very serious threat to the society I would like to live in and, at best, a subject to be made an example of.

Am I then, ultimately, better than the murderer?

Yes, according to my own subjective scale.  He, the man living in our society, under specific rules, was the one who, unprovoked, killed a man.  I say we see him out of this life in the same way that he saw that innocent man out.  Lest we let him sit in jail and rot, taking up tax-payers' money.

Please, do keep in mind that I am aware of the fact that people are wrongfully accused of horrendous crimes and sentenced to death for it.  I'm referring to cases where there is no doubt.

Things of this nature.  We're too lenient.
